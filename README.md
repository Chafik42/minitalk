## Summary

This project is an introduction of the Signal in the Unix environnement.

It its a very usefull project, because it can create a lot of possibilites for future use.

You have to make communicate a server, and a client, the server will receive the message of the client, and the goal is to receive the message as fast as possible.

In the bonus you can make a ping pong implementation, the server will send a signal to the client that he received the message.

Another bonus is to handle emoji, the client will send an emoji as a message, and the server will correctly display it.

All of that is made possible by the signal and wait function, and a good skill on bitwise operation (some of the High school courses are usefull).
